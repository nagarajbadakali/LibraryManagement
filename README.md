# 📚 Library Management System (Python CLI)

A **clean, structured, Object-Oriented Python CLI project** for **Library Management**.

This project was built to deeply understand **OOP concepts in Python** (Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Abstraction) and to prepare for a **Python Developer role transition**.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **OOP Concepts Practiced**
- **Classes & Objects**
- **Inheritance** (`Admin`, `Member` from `Person`)
- **Abstraction** (abstract `Person` class)
- **Polymorphism** (`get_details` behaving differently)
- **Encapsulation** (managing availability and login status safely)

✅ **CLI Menu Interface** for clear user-driven interaction, grouped cleanly into Admin, Member, and General Operations.
